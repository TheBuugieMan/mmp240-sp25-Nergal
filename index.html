   <p> I am currently pursuing a degree in Multimedia Programming and Design at Borough of Manhattan Community College and plan to graduate in the fall with my associate's degree. <br><br>
    As a lifelong New York native, I have always been drawn to technology, creativity, and problem-solving. <br><br>
    In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, working on personal projects like robotics and programming, and staying active through workouts. <br><br>
    Over the past year, I have made steady progress in strength training and endurance, continuously pushing myself to improve. <br><br>
    I also have a strong interest in software development, automation, and digital media, and Iâ€™m always looking for new ways to expand my knowledge. <br><br>
    My goal is to combine technology, design, and entrepreneurship to create innovative solutions and achieve long-term success. </p>
